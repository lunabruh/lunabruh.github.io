		<li>1 tbsp of sugar</li>
		<li>Milk</li>
		<li>ice</li>

	<h4>Amazon’s Black Box Is Like a Lost Black Mirror Episode</h4>
    <p>Blumhouse’s new sci-fi thriller is goofy, soapy fun.
	FOR ITS FIRST hour, the new sci-fi horror flick Black Box appears to have collaged its story together using the plotlines of other, better films. A Black man is hypnotized and sucked into his own subconscious by an older lady, à la Get Out; when he isn’t being hypnotized, he’s struggling to piece together what happened on the night of his wife’s death. To function in his amnesiac state, he must follow instructive notes reminding him how to behave, just like in Memento.</p>
